### Why Leaflet is Perfect for PAAN:

3. **PAAN Branding**: Full control over map styling to match PAAN's brand colors
4. **Performance**: Can handle thousands of pins with clustering
5. **Customization**: Perfect for creative industry needs (custom pin designs, portfolio previews)
6. **Future-Proof**: No API limits or vendor dependencies

### Technical Implementation Benefits:

```javascript
// Easy marker customization for different user types
const creativeIcon = L.divIcon({
  className: 'creative-marker',
  html: `<div class="bg-paan-blue rounded-full p-2">üë®‚Äçüé®</div>`
});

const agencyIcon = L.divIcon({
  className: 'agency-marker', 
  html: `<div class="bg-paan-yellow rounded-full p-2">üè¢</div>`
});
```

### Recommended Setup:
- **Base Maps**: OpenStreetMap tiles (free)
- **Fallback**: Multiple tile providers for reliability
- **Clustering**: MarkerClusterGroup for performance
- **Custom Controls**: Filter panels integrated with map
- **Responsive**: Mobile-optimized with touch controls

## Implementation Stack:
```json
{
  "leaflet": "^1.9.4",
  "react-leaflet": "^4.2.1", 
  "react-leaflet-cluster": "^2.1.0",
  "leaflet-defaulticon-compatibility": "^0.1.2"
}
```

This approach gives PAAN maximum flexibility and zero ongoing costs while delivering a premium user experience tailored to the African creative community.
